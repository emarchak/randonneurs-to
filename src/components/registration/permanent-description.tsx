        <p><strong>A Permanent ride</strong> is one of the existing Randonneurs Ontario brevet routes ridden outside of the normal Brevet schedule. Any current Randonneurs Ontario member may propose riding a Permanent, with at least two weeks in advance of the proposed date. Once approved, there can be no changes to the request, except at the discretion of the Chapter VP and Treasurer.</p>
        <p>Standard brevet rules apply for Permanents. Control cards must be completed during the ride, including start and end. Permanents do not take the place of brevets for the ACP Super Randonneur award, nor will they count for qualification for PBP.</p>
